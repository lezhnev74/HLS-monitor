## Reporting
At this version library has no reporting capabilities. 
 
 You will have to write a wrapper for this tool which will capture all of the failed output and will email it to you or report to somewhere.
 
 Pseudo code looks like this:
 
 ```php
 
$playlists = [...many playlists to check...];
$failed_reports = [];

// for each given playlist - make checking
$output = [];
$return_code = 0;
exec('vendor/bin/hls-monitor playlists '.implode(",",$playlists), $output, $return_code);   
    
if($return_code) {
    // there were problems with this palylist
    $failed_reports[] = $output;
}

 
 // then report if anything is not good
 if(count($failed_reports)) {
    // mail reports to somewhere
 }
 
 ```
